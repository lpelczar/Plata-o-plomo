# RogueLike Game called "Plata o plomo"

## Task information

### Story

"La Speluna", a company from San Escobar contacted Codecool and asked about creating a roguelike game for them. They didn't tell us much about their needs, only few details about the game's framework. They are big fans of old-fashioned RPG games, when graphics didn't matter that much, but the most important things were a gameplay and a story.

The game should be about a creature (human? alien? bear? ant?) who is travelling through a dangerous and wild world (planet? table?). At the beginning the creature is weak and fragile, but through the game he (she? it? apache helicopter?) will be leveling up, getting tougher, collecting powerful items and finally be able to defeat an ultimate boss! Of course, the way to the ultimate boss isn't a bed of roses, there will be a lot of obstacles (rivers? lavas? mountains?) and many dangerous enemies (use your imagination!). 

### Game requirements

* Stay with default python's modules - do not use PyGame or Curses.
* Prepare a story - an introduction screen, a character creation screen and a win/lose screen.
* Create a hall of fame screen (highscores) - name, max level, time spent, monsters killed etc.
* Create an about screen (info about authors!) and how-to-play screen (how to move, attack, drink potions etc.)
* Think about at least 2 different levels/areas. Each of them should have an unique "feel".
